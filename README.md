<!-- ## Install it from PyPI

```bash
pip install wfc
``` -->
## Purpose

The final purpose is to make a python implementation of ideas around the wave function collapse algorithm.

It probably already exists and this is mainly done to learn.

| Description                                                                                                                                                              | Done |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---- |
| Basic implementation following https://www.terbium.io/2018/11/wave-function-collapse/                                                                                    | YES  |
| Add backtracking                                                                                                                                                         |      |
| Add tests                                                                                                                                                                |      |
| Base Tiles from Image                                                                                                                                                    |      |
| Ability to generate large images (probably via doing many images in parallel and merging them somehow)                                                                   |      |
| Implement everything in torch to use it as part of a neural network (??? backward step should go through this? but not implemented this way? need to think about it :D ) |      |
